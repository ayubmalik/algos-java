# Algorithms Notes

## Five algorithm approaches

* Examplify - Write out specific examples of problem and figure general rule e.g. Clock angle between hours and minutes
* Pattern Matching - what is it similar to and modify a solution e.g. sorted array rotated, find minimum
* Simplify & Generalize - change a constraint to simplify, then generalize e.g. ransom note, chars then words
* Base Case & Build - Solve for base case/one element the two etc., good for recursion e.g. string permutation
* Data Structure Brainstorm - run through list of data structures and try each one e.g. LinkedList, array, binary tree?
